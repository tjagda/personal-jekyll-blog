# IT Technician

## Linamar Corporation<br>(Oct 2012 - Jan 2013)

My very first co-op was actually when I was in high school in grade 10.

I was fortunate enough to get an experience at [Linamar](https://linamar.com/) and defintely get my foot in the door to my future experiences.

My main responsibilities consisted of troubleshooting hardware/software problems of other co-workers and teaching them ways to prevent future problems.

At one point, I also had to go through many machines to wipe and image computers for new onboarding employees.

But definitely the most fun part was in my less busy time, my manager would have me edit videos on Adobe Premiere and learn how to do certain things so that I can teach her later.
