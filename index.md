# Who am I?

My name is Timothy Josh Agda but I normally just go by Josh. 

Currently I am working as a software engineer at the Centre of Biodiversity Genomics. 

But before that I studied Computer Science at the University of Guelph, had great experiences in my university and highschool co-ops where I learned a ton on the fundementals of the craft! 

In my free time, I like to dabble with my computer and Linux (currently using Manjaro), listen/play to music, and relax on my bed.

This is a minimalistic blog / portfolio because I like to keep things simple and manageable, but feel free to check out my posts on my experiences, Linkedin, or Github.
